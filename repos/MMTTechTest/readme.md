In my defense - I have also fixed the washing machine. Ran over the four hours as a result but, rather than take the mickey, this is some additional stuff I'd like to have done:

1) Moreunit testing of all data tasks - started moqing the data context but more to do. Also mocking of the api call to the external api

2) authentication - not in the brief though

3) App starts at .../swagger; swagger docs are available at root

4) appsettings needs environment-specific DB connection strings

5) needs an elegant badrequest/ error page for non-dev

6) would want to move the license etc swagger stuff out to appsettings.json

7) probably want to override swagger css

8) I was doing funtional testing using swagger. PostMan hates me. Needs resolved.
